		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Demo Frontend Integration and Client Onboarding",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide frontend integration into: demo frontend API service updates with authentication, environment variable configuration, API version compatibility checking, and end-to-end workflow validation with comprehensive error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity requiring frontend-backend integration, environment configuration, version compatibility, and maintaining user experience while adding authentication layer."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Supabase Authentication Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase infrastructure setup into discrete configuration steps: project creation, OAuth provider setup (Google and Apple separately), database schema creation with RLS policies, and environment configuration for development and production.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple OAuth providers, database schema design, RLS policies, and cross-platform configuration requirements. Involves external service integrations with Google Cloud Console and Apple Developer Portal."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Supabase Authentication in React Frontend",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the React authentication integration into logical components: Supabase client setup, authentication context creation, OAuth sign-in components, session management, and error handling implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving React context patterns, OAuth flows, session persistence, and state management. Requires understanding of Supabase client library and React authentication patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Rate Limiting Display and Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down rate limiting UI into components: quota service implementation, progress display component, real-time subscription setup, and admin user handling with custom hooks.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving real-time subscriptions, UI state management, and database integration. Requires careful handling of admin vs regular user flows and real-time updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend JWT Verification and Rate Limiting",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate backend authentication into critical components: JWT verification middleware, rate limiting service, database operations, admin bypass logic, error handling, logging, and endpoint protection integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving security-critical JWT verification, atomic database operations, middleware implementation, and integration with existing FastAPI endpoints. Requires careful handling of concurrent requests and proper error responses."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Guided Tutorial System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the tutorial system into UI components: tutorial state management, overlay and spotlight components, navigation system, content delivery with sample data, and completion tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving React Context, Portal rendering, complex CSS effects, state persistence, and mobile responsiveness. Requires sophisticated UX design and interaction handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Netlify Production Deployment",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize deployment configuration into setup phases: Netlify project configuration, environment variable setup, domain and SSL configuration, and build optimization with security headers.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving deployment configuration, environment management, and build optimization. Straightforward but requires attention to security and performance details."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Frontend with Authenticated Backend API",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure API integration updates into focused areas: authentication header integration, rate limiting error handling, token refresh implementation, and comprehensive error handling for different failure scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving API service updates, error handling patterns, and authentication token management. Requires careful integration with existing API functions and proper error user experience."

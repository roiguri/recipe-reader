## üéØ Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Users currently cannot share recipe URLs directly from their mobile devices to the Recipe Box Demo application. When URL extraction fails, the shared URLs are lost, requiring users to manually re-enter them. There's no dedicated workflow for managing shared recipes that haven't been fully processed yet.

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive mobile sharing system that:
- Enables direct URL sharing from mobile devices via Web Share Target API
- Preserves all shared URLs regardless of extraction success/failure
- Provides a dedicated "Shared Recipes" management interface
- Offers seamless workflow from shared URL to saved recipe

### Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in recipe processing from mobile devices
- **URL Retention**: 100% of shared URLs preserved (zero data loss)
- **Conversion Rate**: 75% of successfully extracted shared recipes saved to user collections
- **User Satisfaction**: 90% positive feedback on mobile sharing experience

## üîç Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- ‚úÖ URL scraping endpoint exists in Recipe API
- ‚úÖ Supabase Edge Function handles secure proxy with auth/rate limiting
- ‚úÖ User authentication via Google/GitHub OAuth
- ‚úÖ User quota system (`demo_rate_limits` table)
- ‚úÖ Recipe saving (`user_recipes` table)
- ‚úÖ Real-time quota tracking

### Current Limitations
- ‚ùå No mobile sharing capability
- ‚ùå Failed URL extractions result in data loss
- ‚ùå No workflow for managing partially processed recipes
- ‚ùå Users must manually re-enter failed URLs

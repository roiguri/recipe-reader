        "description": "Implement atomic database operations to prevent concurrent requests from bypassing rate limits by using FOR UPDATE locking or stored procedures for thread-safe rate limit checking and incrementing.",
        "details": "Current implementation has a race condition where multiple concurrent requests can read the same usage count before any updates are committed, allowing all requests to pass rate limiting checks. This creates a security vulnerability where users can exceed their rate limits by making simultaneous requests.\n\nImplementation Options:\n\n1. **FOR UPDATE Locking Approach:**\n   - Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to lock the rate limit row during transaction\n   - Check current usage against limit\n   - Increment usage count within same transaction\n   - Commit or rollback based on rate limit check\n\n2. **Stored Procedure Approach:**\n   - Create PostgreSQL function that atomically checks and increments\n   - Return success/failure status and updated count\n   - Single database call reduces network overhead\n\n3. **Upsert with Conflict Resolution:**\n   - Use INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE\n   - Increment usage count atomically\n   - Check limit within database constraint or trigger\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n- **Security vs Performance:** Atomic operations may increase latency but prevent bypass\n- **Increment Timing:** Consider incrementing before API call (fail-safe) vs after (accurate billing)\n- **Deadlock Prevention:** Use consistent locking order if multiple resources involved\n- **Error Handling:** Distinguish between rate limit exceeded vs database errors\n- **Transaction Isolation:** Ensure appropriate isolation level for consistency\n\n**Code Example (FOR UPDATE approach):**\n```sql\nBEGIN;\nSELECT requests_used, requests_limit \nFROM demo_rate_limits \nWHERE user_id = $1 \nFOR UPDATE;\n-- Check limit in application logic\nUPDATE demo_rate_limits \nSET requests_used = requests_used + 1, updated_at = NOW() \nWHERE user_id = $1;\nCOMMIT;\n```",
